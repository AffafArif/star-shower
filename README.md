# Star Shower

The Star Shower project is an engaging visual animation that creates a dynamic, interactive starry night scene on an HTML canvas. Using JavaScript, this project renders falling "stars" that bounce and shatter upon hitting the ground or the screen edges. Each shattered star emits smaller particles, creating a vivid shower effect as they disappear gradually. The background has a gradient simulating a night sky, with mountain ranges of varying shades providing depth to the landscape. The stars appear randomly, and each one has unique physics properties like gravity, friction, and velocity, making the scene more realistic and immersive.
